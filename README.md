# Endless Runner game

## Description
This project consists of an endless runner type game coded in Unity. The game consists of an astronaut that runs endlessly through different platforms while avoiding different obstacles. The obstacles consist of walls, fire, and different shaped platforms. In order to avoid losing, the player can move from left to right, jump and turning left or right if needed. At the same time, throwing magic is possible in order to destroy walls.

There are coins that appear on random platforms that increase the current score. There are 3 lives per game, which are presented on top of the screen, as well as the current score.

The game starts with a menu which allows starting the game, showing the controls, changing the SFX and music levels, and there is an option to see the previous and top score.
